## Overview
Safe-CLIP is an ehnanced vision-and-language model designed to mitigate the risks associated with NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content in AI applications.

Based on the CLIP model, Safe-CLIP is fine-tuned to serve the association between linguistic and visual concepts, ensuring **safer outputs** in text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval and generation tasks.

## Installation
To create the conda environment named safe-clip use the following instructions.
With this environment you have all the packages to run the code inside this repo. 
```
conda create -n safe-clip python==3.10
conda activate safe-clip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Text-to-Image
Section to perform Text-to-Image generation, starting from a user text input.
It is possbile to use the "safeclip_t2i_generation_pipeline.py" script from the repository or the google colab notebook interactive demo. 

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gz2333WX6U7veCUKYwhXF8dXp4UCeLoU?usp=sharing) 

We provide a code snippet to generate images without NSFW contents.


```python
conda activate safe-clip

out_dir="your_path"
cd "$out_dir/safe-clip"

python -u safeclip_t2i_generation_pipeline.py
``` 

## Image-to-Text
Here we introduce the Image-to-Text generation code.

The code snippet use the LLaVA architecture to answer questions to an image.
The user can specificy an image `image-file` and a question `query` through the parameter of the script. Moreover, you can choose between two mutually exclusive architectures.
`paper_model` uses one of the [first architecture of LLaVA](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-llama-2-13b-chat-lightning-preview), with Lllama 2 as LLM and the image is processed at the resolution of 224px.
`llava_15` uses [LLaVA 1.5](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-13b) with Vicuna as LLM and the image is considered with a resolution of 336px.

```python
conda activate safe-clip

out_dir="your_path"
cd "$out_dir/safe-clip/LLaVA_generation"

python -u main.py --paper_model
```
